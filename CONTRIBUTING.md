### üìö Documentation
- **README improvements**
- **Code comments** and docstrings
- **Usage examples** and tutorials
- **Security best practices** documentation

## üöÄ Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- Python 3.8 or higher
- Git
- Basic understanding of web security concepts
- Familiarity with WAF bypass techniques (for payload contributions)

### Development Setup

1. **Fork the repository**
   ```bash
   # Click the "Fork" button on GitHub
   ```

2. **Clone your fork**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/WAFBreaker.git
   cd WAFBreaker
   ```

3. **Create a virtual environment**
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Install dependencies**
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   pip install -r requirements-dev.txt  # If available
   ```

5. **Create a feature branch**
   ```bash
   git checkout -b feature/your-feature-name
   # or
   git checkout -b bugfix/issue-description
   ```

## üìù Development Guidelines

### Code Style
- **Follow PEP 8** Python style guidelines
- **Use meaningful variable names** and function names
- **Add docstrings** to all functions and classes
- **Keep functions focused** and single-purpose
- **Comment complex logic** and WAF bypass techniques

### Security Considerations
- **Never include real vulnerabilities** in example code
- **Sanitize any sensitive information** from commits
- **Test payloads responsibly** on authorized systems only
- **Document security implications** of new features

### Payload Development
When contributing new payloads:

```python
# Example payload structure
class NewPayloadModule:
    def __init__(self):
        self.name = "Descriptive Name"
        self.category = "xss|sqli|cmdi|lfi|etc"
        self.description = "Brief description of the technique"
    
    def generate_payload(self, target_param, options=None):
        """
        Generate payload with proper documentation
        
        Args:
            target_param (str): Parameter to inject into
            options (dict): Additional options for customization
            
        Returns:
            list: List of generated payloads
        """
        # Implementation here
        pass
```

### Testing
- **Test on multiple WAF types** when possible
- **Include unit tests** for new functions
- **Verify payload effectiveness** in controlled environments
- **Test edge cases** and error conditions
